# R5T.Z0067
Project directory relative paths.


## How this repository works

Values start out in one of the Z## sub-libraries:

* Z001 - Rivet-convention, general, framework-typed, project directory relative paths.

And these value instance listings are forwarded to complementary value instance listings in this library.


## Prior Work

* R5T.Z0007 - Rivet-specific project directory relative paths.
